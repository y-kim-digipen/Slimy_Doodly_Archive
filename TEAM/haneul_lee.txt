-Personal Notes : Being a Producer was really fun and interesting role for me 
because it was first time for me. I may poor than other producers in other teams,
however I try my best to do work as Producer. I manage my team members time efficiently,
divide the works well, etc. I studied many things with these whole things. Now I have great confidence
with the role 'Producer' to be better than before.
