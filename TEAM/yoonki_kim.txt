-Personal Notes : I was always wanted to know how platformer game works. Thanks to Prof. Kevin he covered lots of things we might struggle. And also
	               Luckly I could work as TD, I could learn from internet and implement platformer games' basic. And also, I choosed the concept not too
	               complicated, project was hard on prototype and beta period, but after that we do not have lots things to do just polishing. It makes our
	               teams not get stressed much. And I satisfy my work and what I learned from this project.
